    - quote: Dung len, va hay lay niem tin lam vu khi cua ban
    - quote: A man who governs his passions is master of his world. We must either
        command them or be enslaved by them. It is better to be a hammer than an
        anvil.
    - quote: Arm yourself with prayer rather than a sword; wear humility rather than
        fine clothes.
